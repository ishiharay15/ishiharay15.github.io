### **Dataset Information**

- **Number of Samples:** 109,446
- **Categories:** 5
  1. Non-ectopic beats (normal)
  2. Supraventricular ectopic beats
  3. Ventricular ectopic beats
  4. Fusion beats
  5. Unknown beats
- **Resampling:** The dataset was resampled to balance class distribution.

### **Skills and Learning Outcomes**

- Designing and training a custom 1D CNN for biomedical signal classification.
- Visualizing data augmentation and performance metrics.
- Evaluating models using learning curves and confusion matrices.

### **Sample Outputs**
