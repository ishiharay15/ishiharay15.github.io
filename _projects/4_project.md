This page highlights **Mini-Project B1**, a teaching module I created for college-level machine learning students. This lab focuses on classifying ocular diseases using OCT scans, addressing data imbalance, and interpreting models through saliency mapping and clustering. **All solutions and outputs shown here are generated by me as the class is actively using this lab.**

## **Overview of Mini-Project**

This project demonstrates the following skills:

- **Medical Imaging Analysis:** Preprocessing and augmenting OCT scans.
- **Deep Learning for Classification:** Training models to classify ocular conditions.
- **Model Evaluation:** Utilizing metrics like ROC and AUC.
- **Model Interpretability:** Implementing saliency mapping with Grad-CAM.
- **Handling Data Imbalance:** Adjusting for imbalanced datasets with weighted sampling.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Performing KMeans clustering for exploratory analysis.

## **Detailed Steps in the Lab:**

### **1. Dataset Setup and Training**

- Load images from the OCT dataset.
- Perform data augmentations to improve model generalization.
- Create dataset loaders and visualize class distributions.

  **OCT Class Visualization:**
  {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/4_project/classes.png" title="OCT Scan Class Visualization" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

- Train a deep learning model to classify ocular conditions.

---

### **2. Model Evaluation**

- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:

  - Loss and accuracy.
  - ROC and AUC curves for binary and multi-class classification.

  **ROC and AUC Curve Visualization:**
  <div style="width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">
    {% include figure.liquid 
        loading="eager" 
        path="assets/img/4_project/roc_auc.png" 
        title="ROC and AUC Curve" 
        class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" 
    %}
  </div>

---

### **3. Model Interpretability**

- Implement saliency mapping using the Grad-CAM library.
- Highlight regions of OCT scans that contribute most to the model's predictions.
- Generate visual explanations of model decisions.

  **Grad-CAM Saliency Mapping:**

### **4. Handling Data Imbalance**

- Train the model on an unbalanced version of the dataset.
- Use weighted sampling to adjust for imbalanced class distributions.
- Compare model performance before and after balancing.

---

### **5. Unsupervised Learning**

- Apply KMeans clustering to OCT scan features.
- Visualize cluster assignments for exploratory data analysis.

  **KMeans Clustering on OCT Data:**
  {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/4_project/kmeans_clustering.png" title="KMeans Clustering Results" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

  **Example: KMeans Clustering on MNIST Dataset:**

  Also apply on MNIST Dataset as verification for clustering.
