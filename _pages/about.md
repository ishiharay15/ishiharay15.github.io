I am a 1st year working on my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, Davis!
I am advised by Prof. Chen-Nee Chuah as a member of
<a href="https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~chuah/rubinet">RUBINET Research Lab</a>.
I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UC Davis in March 2024.
