I am a 1st year working on my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, Davis! I am advised by Prof. Chen-Nee Chuah as of member of <a href="https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~chuah/rubinet">RUBINET Research Lab</a>. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UC Davis in March 2024.
My research focus is in computer vision and optimization on edge devices, with an extra interest in the field of robotics.
